    python 2.7 (Other versions may work, but developed and tested with this version)  
    JLink installed and accessed via $PATH

The hexmerge.py utility is part of the intelhex python package.  
It is assumed you already have pip installed.  
The command below will install intelhex (and hexmerge.py).  

     $ sudo pip install intelhex

**NOTE:** hexmerge can take quite a while to run; up to a minute or longer.

The sequence of operations are --  

      $ make clean
      $ make [debug|release]
      $ make flash
      
or  

     $ make clean  
     $ make flash  

Once the unified hexfile is build, you can repeately flash units with
        make flash

The products of this makefile are
